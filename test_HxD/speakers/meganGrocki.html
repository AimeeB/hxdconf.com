	<h5 class="speech-title">Main Conference: Research &amp; Design Methods</h5>
	<p class="body-text">Does your organization have a plan to infuse user research into the design process? Do you struggle converting research into actual designs? Do you have trouble coming to consensus around design decisions and avoiding churn?</p> 

	<p class="body-text">We will share our secrets with you on the best methods for generating extraordinary ideas and design concepts, based on research and a deep understanding of the patient (or customer) journey.</p> 
    
	<h5 class="speech-title">Workshop: Walk a Mile in My Shoes: Mapping the Patient Journey</h5> 
	
	<p class="body-text">Whether you’re sick, healthy, or somewhere in between, navigating the world of healthcare and hospitals can throw anyone for a loop. Patient journey maps are invaluable for healthcare organizations of all kinds. </p>
	<p class="body-text">In this workshop, we’ll work together to build a journey map based on our collective knowledge of the patient experience, the various touch points involved, and the roles they play. We will also look at how the journey map differs according to specific conditions (e.g chronic health issues or point of need).</p>
	<p class="body-text">Outputs for the session will cover the following topics:
		<ol>
			<li>Understanding the value of journey maps, and how and when they can be used by various types of healthcare organizations. For example, for design adherence programs, to determine referral processes, and to ensure more patient friendly hospital experiences.</li>
			<li>Creating a journey map: research techniques, from guerilla research to strategic research.</li>
			<li>Maintaining the steady state – how do you keep your journey maps current? How do you convince other organizations to adopt them?</li> 
		</ol>
