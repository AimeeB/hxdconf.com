	<h5 class="speech-title">Weathering the perfect storm: 
	Design &amp; management strategies for hospital technology systems
	</h5>
	
	<p class="body-text">The technological demands of the hospital environment are huge and complex. Many large healthcare projects require the technology designer to account for eight to ten different systems. To keep track of each individual system, the design team often develops a technology responsibility matrix. In some cases, this matrix can grow to an almost uncontrollable size, with more than 300 systems, which can result in confusion over responsibilities, accountability, and deliverables. Technology design teams end up facing a perfect storm: significant budget challenges, ongoing scope gaps, and the high probability of significant last-minute work by the often-overworked internal team at the hospital.</p> 

	<p class="body-text">Technology systems design has become an essential component of the healthcare design process.  Responding to owner demand for technology-driven healthcare facilities and governmental requirements for information-based care, the technology design role has matured into a mainstay of the healthcare design community.  However, evolving project needs have eclipsed the commonly understood scope, responsibility, and capabilities of the traditional technology engineer.</p> 
	
	<p class="body-text">This presentation will discuss a new model for managing the technology avalanche based upon business analysis, use-case development, and comprehensive program management.  With an emerging track record of success, this new model eliminates shortcomings of the current design development system, and centralizes ownership/leadership of the full technology program.</p>

	<p class="body-text">Learning objectives (4)</p>
    <ul> 
	<li>Participants will recognize that the design team must account for hundreds of technology systems and applications in todayâ€™s healthcare facility design process.</li>
	
	<li>Participants will describe the differences in the capabilities of traditional technology engineer verses the high-level technology consultant.</li>
	
	<li>Participants will be able to explain the new model for managing the technology avalanche in hospitals.</li>
	
	<li>Participants will extend the knowledge gained in this session to their hospital projects for more successful project outcomes.</li> 
     </ul>
