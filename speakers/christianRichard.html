	<p class="body-text">What does designing an AED have to do with two ball bearings?</p>
	<p class="body-text">For people that experience sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), the chance of survival decreases approximately 10% for each minute that passes. Time is of the essence when performing a rescue, but Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel must frequently contend with noise, extreme temperatures, uncertain lighting conditions, and an unstable physical setting (picture an ambulance travelling over speed bumps).  Creating an easy-to-use EMS device requires that we follow a user-centered design approach to ensure a device that meets up to this intense, high stakes environment. In his presentation, Christian will share his experiences and the process developing Philips’s latest Automated External Defibrillator. He will explain why, when designing for EMS, you need to know about the story of the two ball bearings.</p>
	<h5 class="speech-title">Bio</h5>
