	<h5 class="speech-title">Main Conference: Research and Design Methods</h5>
	
	<p class="body-text">Does your organization have a plan to infuse user research into the design process? Do you struggle converting research into actual designs? Do you have trouble coming to consensus around design decisions and avoiding churn?</p> 

	<p class="body-text">We will share our secrets with you on the best methods for generating extraordinary ideas and design concepts, based on research and a deep understanding of the patient (or customer) journey.</p> 
	
    <h5 class="speech-title">Workshop: Research-Inspired Design Studio</h5>

	<p class="body-text">This workshop will provide an overview of our preferred research methods and when to use them. In addition we will cover the making of a journey map to illustrate key interactions.  With a shared understanding of the audience and design challenge, we will then break into groups to generate design concepts through a Design Studio activity.</p>

	<p class="body-text">Participants will sketch and present their ideas for solutions, critique and discuss with their teams and iterate their concepts to make improvements. The end-result of a Design Studio is a much deeper understanding of the design challenges at hand, and concepts created out of consensus from all involved. </p>

	<p class="body-text">Professional drawing/illustration skills are not required, but you must be willing to participate and draw basic shapes (we can help!)</p>

	<p class="body-text">You will leave with the tools and framework to facilitate a design studio yourself. Join us!</p>
