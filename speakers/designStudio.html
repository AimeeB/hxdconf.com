	<p class="body-text">This workshop will provide an overview of our preferred research methods and when to use them. In addition we will cover the making of a journey map to illustrate key interactions.  With a shared understanding of the audience and design challenge, we will then break into groups to generate design concepts through a Design Studio activity.</p>

	<p class="body-text">Participants will sketch and present their ideas for solutions, critique and discuss with their teams and iterate their concepts to make improvements. The end-result of a Design Studio is a much deeper understanding of the design challenges at hand, and concepts created out of consensus from all involved. </p>

	<p class="body-text">Professional drawing/illustration skills are not required, but you must be willing to participate and draw basic shapes (we can help!)</p>

	<p class="body-text">You will leave with the tools and framework to facilitate a design studio yourself. Join us!</p>
