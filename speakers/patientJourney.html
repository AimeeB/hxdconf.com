	<p class="body-text">Whether you’re sick, healthy, or somewhere in between, navigating the world of healthcare and hospitals can throw anyone for a loop. Patient journey maps are invaluable for healthcare organizations of all kinds. </p>
	<p class="body-text">In this workshop, we’ll work together to build a journey map based on our collective knowledge of the patient experience, the various touch points involved, and the roles they play. We will also look at how the journey map differs according to specific conditions (e.g chronic health issues or point of need).</p>
	<p class="body-text">Outputs for the session will cover the following topics:
		<ol>
			<li>Understanding the value of journey maps, and how and when they can be used by various types of healthcare organizations. For example, for design adherence programs, to determine referral processes, and to ensure more patient friendly hospital experiences.</li>
			<li>Creating a journey map: research techniques, from guerilla research to strategic research.</li>
			<li>Maintaining the steady state – how do you keep your journey maps current? How do you convince other organizations to adopt them?</li> 
		</ol>

   <p class="body-text">A passionate disciple of all things Experience Design, Jerilyn has been working for over a decade with clients such as Prostate Cancer Foundation, Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Web MD, RiteAid, and many others to design engaging and valuable experiences tailored to the specific needs and goals of each audience.</p> 

<p class="body-text">Although she started out “digital”, Jerilyn now focuses on the human first, the technology second, as she deconstructs cross-channel and multi-touch interactions such as the end-to-end patient experience, the role of collaboration in any interaction, and the emotional connections people develop with the brands and experiences they know and trust.</p>

<p class="body-text">She approaches all of her work by asking 3 core questions:</p>
 <ol>
<li>Who is her audience?</li>
<li>What are they trying to do?</li>
<li>How can she help them do it?</li>
 </ol>

<p class="body-text">Using these questions (and their answers) as her guide, Jerilyn is able to ensure that business goals and customer / patient / employee needs are tightly aligned ensuring long-term success and loyalty.</p>

<p class="body-text">Jerilyn speaks regularly at conferences about her work with patients, doctors, pharmacists, insurance companies, support networks, and other touch points within the patient continuum and the key barriers each faces in improving patient outcomes.</p>
