		<p class="body-text">For a person living with a hidden disability such as diabetes, the desire for social inclusion can have a significant impact on day-to-day disease management. Insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices have and will continue to provide advanced technological solutions, however, they have been designed and marketed using a medical rather than social model. Hanky Pancreas, LLC applies principles of fashion and user-centered design to medicine by developing a series of products that transform wearable diabetes technologies into a key fashion accessory and conversation piece.</p>
