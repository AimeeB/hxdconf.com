		<h2>Amy Cueva</h2>
		<p class="body-text">Amy Cueva is Founder, Chief Experience Officer and healthcare principal at Mad*Pow. Amy’s passion for human-centered design has been demonstrated repeatedly in her work for clients like New England Journal of Medicine, Google, Aetna, Fidelity and McKesson. Leading a team of equally fired-up designers, Amy has created strong multi-channel experience strategies, intuitive digital experiences and streamlined processes for Mad*Pow’s clients.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Amy is a true believer in the power of research-inspired methodology to address the challenge of competing business goals, customer needs, and technology requirements. With the state of healthcare in our country rapidly approaching a crisis point, harnessing that power has become even more critical. Amy formed the Healthcare Experience Design LinkedIn group and chairs the Conference with that goal in mind, bringing together those invested in the design of healthcare experiences to discuss best practices, trends, challenges and solutions.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Always happy to step up and spread the word about the importance of human-centered design, Amy is a regular speaker at a wide range of industry events. She has presented at HIMSS virtual conference, the World Healthcare Innovation &amp; Technology Congress, the IA Summit, IDEA Conference, the UPA International Conference, and the Center for Connected Health Symposium. She was selected as one of Mass High Tech’s Women to Watch in 2009 and her and her business partners were honored to be present on the Inc 500 list of fastest growing privately held companies in 2009.
