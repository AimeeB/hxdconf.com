		<h5 class="speech-title">Improve Outcomes with Checklists</h5>
		<p class="body-text">Atul Gawande showed how a simple checklist could dramatically improve surgical outcomes in his book "The Checklist Manifesto". AgaMatrix believes that a similar, checklist driven approach can also lead to better design outcomes. A few questions asked before a project starts, while it is in progress, and after it is completed can help improve the chances that your project will help patients and succeed in the market. This talk details lessons learned creating the first FDA cleared iOS medical device and the decision making process we used that helped us sell over 2 million meters and a billion sensors in partnership with the top pharmaceutical companies and retailers.</p>
