		<p class="body-text">Healthcare systems claim to be acutely aware of the human condition and of people’s needs. But in their insistence on creating a system largely based on clinical research, and a passing empathy for user input, they have failed. Healthcare is not about an opportunity to change lives, it is about an obligation.</p>
		<p class="body-text">And, changing behavior isn't about knowledge. It's about human consciousness; being fully aware of one’s own existence, sensations, thoughts, surroundings, and much more. Einstein said, "No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it."</p> 

		<p class="body-text">We have to radically alter the way we approach designing systems that are intended to improve the health and lives of the people we serve. This talk will focus on key insights you can use to change your state of consciousness, including:</p>

		<ul>
	    <li>Understanding the critical importance of design and taking steps to make sure it has a central place at the table.</li>

		<li>Allowing intuition, exploration and behavioral psychology to inform the systems you design.</li>

		<li>Exploring the impact of motivational forces, both conscious and unconscious, on human behavior and attitudes – and designing systems that acknowledge these forces.</li>
	    </ul>
		<p class="body-text">When you leave this talk you will have some meaningful tools that will enable you to start addressing failed systems and create a new approach that will have real impact, and result in lasting behavior change.</p>
