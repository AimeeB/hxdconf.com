		<h5 class="speech-title">Dr. BJ Fogg's Masterclass in Behavior Design: One Full Day of Hands-on Learning</h5>
		<p class="body-text">I invite you to join me in Boston for a full day of learning how to create products that change people's behavior. At this event I will teach you insights from my Stanford work as well as methods from my 2-day Persuasion Boot Camps. I call this approach "Behavior Design."</p> 

		<p class="body-text">My Masterclass in Boston will change how you view the landscape of human behavior, giving you unusual clarity in your work projects.</p> 

		<h4>Focus Areas</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Human Nature - What makes us tick</li>
		<li>Behavior Insights - How behavior works</li>
		<li>Persuasive Technology - How to use tech channels for influence</li>
		<li>Design Methods - How to design for impact, step by step</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="body-text">My Masterclass is practical, not theoretical. During our time together, I will guide your practice in using my tools -- it's a system about human nature and behavior change that makes sense. Yes, it all fits together.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Seeing the dramatic results from my students’ work, one VC blogged that "BJ has cracked the code" for teaching people to design for behavior change. I’m not sure this is entirely true, but I do know my methods are effective. And I’ll teach them to you.</p> 

		<p class="body-text">You'll learn how three elements must converge to cause behavior: motivation, ability, and triggers. I’ll teach you how to use my Behavior Model in ways I’ve not yet shared online. With this, you can pinpoint and repair problems in user experiences. You'll know why motivation is the *last* element you manipulate, not the first. (What's first? Triggers. I'll teach you why.)</p>

		<p class="body-text">Together we will map out target behaviors and evaluate them in what I call “priority mapping.” You'll also learn a process for designing and testing solutions step by step. I call this process "starfishing," and the results are so exciting that people invariably start snapping photos of what we've created together. </p>

		<p class="body-text">Behavior Design is new and unique. I’ve not yet published these methods. So the only way to learn my approach is to enroll in my course at Stanford (not easy to do) or join me in an industry event, like the Masterclass in Boston. It’s a bit expensive, I know; however, by limiting the class size (24 people max) I can teach in a more personal, flexible way. </p>

		<p class="body-text">(After you enroll, I will give you 3 hours of required homework -- reading and videos -- to do *before* you come to class. This allows me to be more efficient with our time together. If you don’t want to do homework in advance, please do not enroll.)</p>

		<p class="body-text">By joining me in Boston, you will become more confident and efficient in designing for behavior change. You will gain practical skills to create winning products and services. And your new perspective on human behavior will keep you learning more each day, just by observing normal life. In other words, you will become an expert. </p>

		---

		<p class="body-text">Final note: Did you notice that I’m teaching my Masterclass before the conference, not after? That’s for a reason. I want to meet you early, so once the main event begins, we will already know each other. We will then have time over those two days to talk about your projects. That sequence is more interesting for me, and it’s a better value for you.</p>s

		<h5 class="speaker-title">Director of the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford University</h5>

		<h5 class="speech-title">Bio</h5>
		<p class="body-text">Dr. BJ Fogg directs the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford University. A psychologist and innovator, he devotes at least half of his time to industry projects. His work empowers people to think clearly about the psychology of persuasion — and then to convert those insights into real-world outcomes.</p>

		<p class="body-text">BJ has created a new model of human behavior change, which guides research and design. Outside of Stanford BJ teaches how to apply behavior change insights in a new series of Persuasion Boot Camps.</p>

		<p class="body-text">He is the founder and director of Mobile Health at Stanford, an event that highlights what really works to improve health behavior. Helping people create health habits is one of BJ’s primary interests.</p>

		<p class="body-text">He is the author of Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do, a book that explains how computers can motivate and influence people. His upcoming book 5 Secrets of Behavior Change. BJ is also the co-editor of Mobile Persuasion, as well as Texting 4 Health. Fortune Magazine selected him as a “New Guru You Should Know.”</p>
