		<h5 class="">Juicy Feedback Loops</h5> 
		<p class="body-text">The term “juicy feedback” comes from game design where a small action produces a surprisingly large reaction. David will present six design principles that anyone can use to motivate healthy behavior. Using these principles his company, Vitality, created a wireless pill cap which is helping people take their daily medications over 90% of the time (from a baseline of 70%).  David will also present a framework for tailoring behavioral change programs to offer each person an optimal mix of social feedback, reminders, accountability, education, and financial incentives.</p>
