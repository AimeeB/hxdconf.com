		<p class="body-text">The patient of the past is not the patient of the future.</p>
		<p class="body-text">Mayo Clinic is currently engaged with the Center for Innovation in a multi-year initiative to redesign their outpatient practice, a necessary step for any large healthcare provider who hopes to be relevant and financially aligned with the future. The organizational and operational design of the current clinic has been influenced by the patient of the past and their medical needs. From our exploration, we hypothesize that todayâ€™s patient is significantly different from the patient of the past and new care models should better support the needs, goals, motivations, and emotions of these new patients. Additionally, we believe that the patient of today will continue to change, allowing us to consider a new paradigm of flexible, evolving care models that continue to adapt to the changing needs of patients.</p>
		<p class="body-text">The goal of this presentation will be to share how the current patient and patient of the future differs from the patient of the past and tie these findings to the on-going design explorations being conducted at Mayo Clinic.</p>
